newMaLSTM model 

This project is based on the Siamese LSTM network + attention mechanism + Manhattan distance to achieve the similarity calculation The training data includes: 

(1)Quora sentence data on Kaggle, about 400,000 groups, positive and negative sample ratio 1:1.7 

(2)Stack overflow data, about 350,000 groups 

(3)SemEval 2014 train data, about 5,000 groups
